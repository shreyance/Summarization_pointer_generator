astronomers have produced the first complete three-dimensional view of these beautiful columns of interstellar gas and dust .
the image , together with data collected by nasa , suggests these structures only have three million years left before they fade away - a relatively short time in cosmic terms .
the nebula and its associated objects are located about 7000 light-years away in the constellation of serpens -lrb- the serpent -rrb- .

representative darrell issa asked then secretary of state clinton whether she , or any of her senior staff , had used a personal email account ` to conduct official business ' in december 2012 .
but issa , who wrote as chairman of the house committee on oversight and government reform , was ignored until more than a month after clinton had stepped down in february 2013 .
and even then , the reply did not answer the question - instead going into detail over the state department 's email policy .

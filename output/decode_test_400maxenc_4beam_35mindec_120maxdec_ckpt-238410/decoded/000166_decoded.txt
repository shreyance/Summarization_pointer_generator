the kidnapping of nearly 300 schoolgirls by a jihadist group in nigeria remains a crime almost too horrifying to comprehend .
the girls were abducted on the night of april 14-15 , 2014 , in the town of chibok , in northeastern nigeria .
the government girls secondary school had been closed for a month because of the danger posed by boko haram militants .

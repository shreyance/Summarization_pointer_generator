until now doctors have assumed that the brains of very young babies are not developed enough to feel pain .
it means that newborns often go without painkillers , even during invasive procedures .
until the 1980s it was common practice for babies to go without pain relief during surgery .
but injections are still given and intravenous drips still inserted without pain relief .

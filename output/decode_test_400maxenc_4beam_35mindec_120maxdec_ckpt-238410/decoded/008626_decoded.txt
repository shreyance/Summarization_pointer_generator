a huge marine corps helicopter made an emergency landing on a southern california beach on wednesday .
the ch-53e super stallion landed on the shore of this northern san diego county town shortly after 11:30 am after a low oil-pressure indicator light went on in the cockpit .
the ch-53e copter is twice the size of the humpback whales that sometimes wash up on surrounding shores .
it crouched on the sand below a bluff and only a few yards from the surf line .

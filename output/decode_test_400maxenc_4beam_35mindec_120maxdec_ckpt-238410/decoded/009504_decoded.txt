jacob church , 21 , and joe tobin , 29 , were at an art exhibition when the vault door shut behind them , leaving them trapped in total darkness .
the pair - who had only met earlier in the night - were fed water through a tube to prevent them becoming dehydrated while police kept in contact with them to check their oxygen levels were not getting dangerously low .
after their six-hour ordeal , fire crews with specialist drills were able to cut through the thick concrete walls .

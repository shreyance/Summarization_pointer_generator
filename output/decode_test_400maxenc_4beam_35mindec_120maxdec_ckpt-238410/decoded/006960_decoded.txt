three mormons , all from utah , have realized that they are transgender - a designation not officially recognized by the church of latter day saints .
indeed , church doctrine states anybody who takes transgender identity to the extent of gender reassignment surgery can not be baptized - and could face discipline from church elders if they are already a member of the religion .
however , in the case of annabel jensen , grayson moore and sara jade woodhouse , they have found a way to exist within the mormon universe .

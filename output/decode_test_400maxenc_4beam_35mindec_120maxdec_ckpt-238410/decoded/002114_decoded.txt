gary mabbutt has been left with a 30inch scar following a five hour operation to save his leg .
the ex-tottenham and england star , 53 , was rushed to hospital after waking up at 1am to find that the leg had gone cold back in 2013 .
mabbutt 's diabetes had led to a clogged artery in the limb and doctors warned him it was ` touch and go ' on whether the leg would have to be amputated .
surgeons were required to replace the main artery in his left leg with a vein and needed 112 staples to seal the horrific wound .

almost half of the british public believe the duchess of cornwall should become queen consort when the prince of wales accedes to the throne .
when the prince and camilla became engaged in february 2005 , only 7 per cent of people polled believe that camilla , right , does a good job of carrying out her official duties .
aides have always insisted the duchess does not want to be known as queen and intends to be known as queen .

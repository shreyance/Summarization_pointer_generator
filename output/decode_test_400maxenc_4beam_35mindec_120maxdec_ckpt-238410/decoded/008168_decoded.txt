the gooey deliciousness of a cake fresh out of the oven is unbeatable but they can dry out and get stale very quickly .
freeze your cake for 24 hours straight from the oven and the sponge will be bouncier than ever .
after being frozen for 24 hours , the sponge will be even bouncier because they take on moisture during the freezing process .

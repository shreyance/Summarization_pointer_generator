freddie roach claims floyd mayweather does not deserve to be ranked alongside manny pacquiao .
roach , pacquiao 's trainer , said he rated super-middleweight star andre ward and middleweight sensation gennady golovkin above mayweather despite the american 's unbeaten record and his status as hot favourite for the may 2 showdown against pacquiao .
roach has been vocal in an otherwise low-key and surprisingly respectful build-up to the welterweight showdown .

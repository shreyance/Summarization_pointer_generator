fire boat massey shaw was requisitioned from the london fire brigade in 1940 .
after carrying 600 soldiers back to britain , the boat returned to london where it was restored by a group of volunteers and a trust .
they are now seeking additional funding to allow them to transport massey shaw to dunkirk next month .

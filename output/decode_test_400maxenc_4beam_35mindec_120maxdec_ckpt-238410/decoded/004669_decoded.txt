researchers studied stone tools that were used by people in the early ahmarian culture and the protoaurignacian culture , living in south and west europe and west europe .
they found the human tools were no more effective than neanderthal-created tools of the same era .
researchers say the discovery means we may need to rethink the reasons humans survived neanderthals - and that we may not have behaved as differently as we thought .

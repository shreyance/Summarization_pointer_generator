leeds veteran danny mcguire crossed for one of his side 's seven tries against st helens .
the 19-year-old handley got his big chance due to an injury to england winger tom briscoe and how he has seized it , with six tries in just six super league appearances .
handley 's first try came against the run of play as the one-time leaders crashed to a fourth defeat in their last five matches .

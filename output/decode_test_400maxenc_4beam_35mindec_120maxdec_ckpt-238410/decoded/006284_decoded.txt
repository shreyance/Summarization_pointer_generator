nigel farage faced claims of a ` cover-up ' last night for censoring a poll that suggests he is on course for a humiliating personal defeat in the general election .
the secret ukip-commissioned poll shows that farage has fallen behind his tory opponent in the kent seat he is contesting .
and he is in danger of finishing third , with labour catching up fast .
if the poll is accurate , it could end farage 's political career as he has vowed to resign as ukip leader if he fails to win south thanet .

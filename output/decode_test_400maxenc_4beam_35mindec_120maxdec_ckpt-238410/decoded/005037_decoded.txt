a series of billboards posted around new york city are seeking to encourage residents to consider a move east to detroit .
the ads are the brainchild of a trio of people opening a new thai restaurant in the motor city who not only want exposure for their new business but also to promote detroit as an alternative for new yorkers who feel that city has got too expensive for them .
she , together with chef brad greenhill , live in detroit while a third partner , philip kafka , owns the new york-based boutique billboard company responsible for the ads .

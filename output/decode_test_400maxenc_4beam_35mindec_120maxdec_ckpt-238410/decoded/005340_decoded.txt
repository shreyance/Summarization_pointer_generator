two passenger jets allegedly came within 25 seconds of a mid-air collision over the arabian sea .
one of the carriers involved , dubai-based emirates , referred to the apparent near-miss as an ` air traffic control incident ' in a statement on wednesday .
neither the dubai carrier nor abu dhabi-based etihad airways would say how close the two planes came to each other .

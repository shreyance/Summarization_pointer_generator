greg hardy , who signed with the dallas cowboys last month , will be forced to sit out the first 10 games of the season and will not receive his salary for these games .
this comes almost one year after hardy , 25 , was convicted by a judge last july of beating , strangling and threatening to kill ex-girlfriend nicki holder .
the decision to ban hardy followed a two-month nfl investigation that started after the dismissal of his domestic violence case in february .

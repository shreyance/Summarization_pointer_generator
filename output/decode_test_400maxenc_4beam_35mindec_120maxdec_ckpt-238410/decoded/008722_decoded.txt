nearly 500 british holidaymakers were stranded overnight on an impounded cruise ship in lisbon harbour .
the ship had been set to leave lisbon at 7pm on tuesday but lawyers slapped a court order on the ship over an ` unresolved ' and ` historic ' financial wrangle .
the legal dispute was between owners portuscale cruise - from which they were chartering the vessel - and one of that company 's former staff .

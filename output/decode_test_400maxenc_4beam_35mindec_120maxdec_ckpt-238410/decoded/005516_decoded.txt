teachers are set to call for ` play in the curriculum ' for schoolchildren up to seven as this is more suitable than educating them in a formal way .
many children are not ready to sit down and do reading , writing and maths when they start school at the age of four or five .
they want the uk to follow the lead of countries like finland and introduce 45-minute lessons immediately followed by 15-minute play times .

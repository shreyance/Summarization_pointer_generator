mahendra ahirwar , 12 , from madhya pradesh in central india , suffers from a rare condition that makes his neck bend and his head hang from his body .
his weak backbone means he ca n't stand or walk and is restricted to a sitting position .
mahendra can just about crawl but needs help to eat and go to the toilet .

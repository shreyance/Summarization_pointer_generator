vladimir putin appeared on russian tv today like you have never seen him before - leading to questions that he has cosmetic surgery to get rid of the bags under his eyes , wrinkles and make his face more chiseled .
his appearance this week is radically different to how he was previously pictured in 2007 -lrb- left -rrb- and 2010 -lrb- left -rrb- and 2010 -lrb- left -rrb- and 2001 .
in a photo dated 2000 , putin 's hair still has tones of blonde but the signs of ageing are becoming more apparent on his features .

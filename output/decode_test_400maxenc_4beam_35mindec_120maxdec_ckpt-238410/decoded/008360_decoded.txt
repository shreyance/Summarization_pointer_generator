investigators have rescued 550 fisherman slaves from a remote indonesian island after returning to the scene of an earlier rescue to check nobody was left behind .
a dramatic rescue earlier in the week led to the discovery of massive rights abuses in benjina and surrounding waters .
the toll of 550 did not include men - many of whom also were enslaved - from poor parts of thailand .

graphic signs telling visitors not to stop for a poo break during their walk to the holy city of santiago de compostela .
but no one knows who put up the signs , which show a squatting figure defecating within a red circle with a diagonal line across it .
the pilgrimage begins at various points , with the longest route nearly 500 miles from the spain-france border , which lead to the cathedral of santiago de compostela , where saint james the great is said to be buried .

a new islamic fatwa in turkey has decreed that muslims are allowed to use toilet paper .
the set of rules for how muslims should relieve themselves , called the qadaa al-haajah , was established in the times before toilet paper or toilet seats were invented .
the code also states that followers should not speak or read while on the toilet and should enter with their left foot and leave with their right , speaking a prayer .

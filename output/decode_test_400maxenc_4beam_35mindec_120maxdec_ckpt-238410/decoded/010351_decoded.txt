the australian government has won its bid to ban the boss of the nation 's biggest bikie gang from australia .
three federal court judges ruled that vella , 61 - who is regularly described as a millionaire businessman - be prohibited from returning after the government cancelled the rebels bikie gang president 's visa while he was overseas in his native malta last year .
the decision strands vella in malta , leaving behind in australia 24 close family members including a wife , sons and an elderly mother , all of whom are australian citizens .

reverend creflo dollar , 53 , launched an appeal last month for 200,000 people to each donate ' $ 300 or more ' so that he could purchase a gulfstream g650 to replace his current damaged aircraft .
the wealthy televangelist , who is known to own two rolls royces and multi-million dollar homes , came under heavy criticism for the appeal but has insisted he needs the plane for preaching work .

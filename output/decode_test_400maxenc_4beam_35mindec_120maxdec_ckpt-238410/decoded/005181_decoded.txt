a memorial display at dusseldorf airport has revealed the first photograph of hero captain patrick sondheimer , the pilot of the doomed flight .
yet the shrine , which was erected in memory of the staff killed during the tragedy , controversially also includes a picture of co-pilot andreas lubitz .
mr lubitz is the man who orchestrated the disaster by steering flight 9525 , from barcelona to dusseldorf , into the mountains killing all of those on board .

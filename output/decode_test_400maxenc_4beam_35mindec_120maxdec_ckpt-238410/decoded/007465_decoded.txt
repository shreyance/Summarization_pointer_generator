united airlines stopped a prominent security researcher from boarding a california-bound flight late saturday , following a social media post by the researcher days earlier suggesting the airline 's onboard systems could be hacked .
the researcher , chris roberts , attempted to board a united flight from colorado to san francisco to speak at a major security conference there this week , but was stopped by the airline 's corporate security at the gate .

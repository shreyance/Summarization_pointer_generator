u.s. army sergeant dan urman 's father eitan urman was so happy that as he embraced his son and lifted him off the ground , he slipped on the ice , causing both to tumble over while still hugging .
as part of the planned surprise , eitan and his wife ronit , of scottsdale , arizona , had been invited to drop the puck before the arizona coyotes game against the anaheim ducks on saturday .
eitan urman sits in disbelief in seeing his son dan , who has been stationed in afghanistan since november of 2014 .

dashcam footage shows a giant st. bernard running across a road somewhere in the czech republic with a child trailing behind .
it appears to be a rather uncomfortable excursion , with the young boy going along the ground on his belly with his legs stretched out behind .
as the canine scampers along , his passenger holds tightly to a leash .

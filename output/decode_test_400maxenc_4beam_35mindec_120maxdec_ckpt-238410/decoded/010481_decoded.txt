bizarre pictures have emerged of two models posing seductively with a giant brown bear as part of an anti-hunting campaign .
the photos , taken in a forest outside moscow in russia , show maria sidorova and lidia fetisova hugging and kissing the 650kg bear , named stephen .
organisers wanted to highlight the importance of living ` side-by-side ' with bears and to discourage hunting .

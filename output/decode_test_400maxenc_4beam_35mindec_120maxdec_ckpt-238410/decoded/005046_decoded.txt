donny ray williams , who was once a staffer for the senate homeland security subcommittee , slipped an intern ambien in 2010 before having sex with her while she lay unconscious .
that same year , he had sex with a woman too inebriated to give her consent , prosecutors say .
despite admitting his guilt in december , d.c. prosecutors on friday asked that williams be spared prison time because he is himself the victim of a crime .

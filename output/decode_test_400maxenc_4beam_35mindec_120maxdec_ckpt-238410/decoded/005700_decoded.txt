scientists have used a new technique to reconstrcut the colourful patterns on 28 fossilised cone snail shells that are up to 6.6 million years old .
the technique has allowed researchers to look millions of years into the past to see how these once elaborately decorated shells would have once looked .
instead of being a simple white colour , they were infact covered in streaks of orange , purple , blue and even large pokadots .

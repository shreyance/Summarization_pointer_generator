dylan miller , 21 , has been living in the one-room hut on juniata 's baker-henry nature reserve in huntingdon , pennsylvania , since september .
he has spent the last eight months studying by lantern and chasing away the occasional bear as his fellow students live comfortably in their dorm rooms .
he hopes living in his nine-foot-tall , 17-by-17ft hut will teach him about living simply , away from the luxuries of the present day .

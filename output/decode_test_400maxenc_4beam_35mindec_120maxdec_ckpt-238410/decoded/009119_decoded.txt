baroness hale of richmond said that she wanted to see the bitterness taken out of most matrimonial disputes so a person does not need to be held at fault in order to obtain a divorce .
divorcing couples currently have to cite one of five reasons : adultery ; two years ' separation with consent ; or five years ' separation without consent .
the second reason -- unreasonable behaviour ' - is by far the most widely used .
around 120,000 couples divorce in england and wales each year and those who want to divorce quickly are encouraged to cite unfaithfulness or unreasonable behaviour .

army major and his wife carolyn are currently on trial for abusing their three foster children .
the trial marks the second go-round for the jacksons , whose previous trial last fall ended in a mistrial when a prosecutor inadvertently referred to the fact that one of the children had died .
the jacksons , who live in mount holly , were stationed at picatinny arsenal , a military installation about 40 miles west of new york city .

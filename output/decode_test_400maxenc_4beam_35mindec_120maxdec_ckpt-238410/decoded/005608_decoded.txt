the gap between wage rises for young and older staff has widened significantly during the past five years .
the under-25s saw their wages rise more than eight times faster than the over-50s , as they quickly climbed the rungs of the career ladder .
last year , workers aged 18 to 24 received bumper 10.6 per cent pay rises , falling to 3.8 per cent for people aged 25 to 34 .

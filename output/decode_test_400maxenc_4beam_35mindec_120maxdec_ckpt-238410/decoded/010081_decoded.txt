researchers at boston university and the university of bath believe this would have meant they lost out when modern humans arrived from africa .
neanderthals , like the reconstruction above on display at the natural history museum in london , may have finally died out as they were unable to get as much energy from their food as modern humans who used fire .
they are often depicted as dim-witted evolutionary losers , but neanderthals were not driven to extinction by their lack of brains .

esa 's rosetta spacecraft has survived a hair-raising encounter with comet 67p .
on saturday the spacecraft had dipped to within nine miles of the surface to take a closer look at the jets that are being ejected from its surface .
but during the manoeuvre , rosetta lost sense of where it was due to the amount of dust and gas and was placed into ` safe mode ' , causing it to momentarily lose contact with earth .

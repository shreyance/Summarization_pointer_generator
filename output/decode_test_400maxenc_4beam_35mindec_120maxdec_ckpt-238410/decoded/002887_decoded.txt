the french state railway company made an official complaint to french prosecutors saying the action in sunday 's prestigious race had risked a deadly tragedy .
the last of the riders went through the barrier in northern france about eight seconds before the tgv train arrived at the waller crossing , 87 kilometers -lrb- 54 miles -rrb- from the end of the so called ` hell of the north ' race .
race organisers said it had not been possible for the leaders to stop in time .

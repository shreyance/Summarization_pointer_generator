at the age of 34 and after 15 years of hoping for the exact opposite , i desperately wanted to be a father , we were financially secure and focus on building a family .
eleven months later , when my body was still not doing what i demanded , i got depressed , stressed and scared .
of course , horror stories in the tabloids tried to persuade me that i had about as much chance of procreating successfully after the age of 30 as i did of making it to the x factor finals .

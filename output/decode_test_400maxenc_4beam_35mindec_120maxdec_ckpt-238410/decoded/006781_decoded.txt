a number of people are currently paying around # 150 a week to live in flats in exclusive parts of mayfair and covent garden in london .
the properties form part of affordable housing because of agreements with developers to provide low-cost provisions when new developments are built over a certain size .
many of them were built years ago in areas which have now become expensive and are worth millions of pounds .

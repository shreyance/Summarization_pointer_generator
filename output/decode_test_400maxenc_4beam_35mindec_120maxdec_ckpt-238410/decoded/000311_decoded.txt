japanese prime minister shinzo abe has pushed for a return to nuclear energy .
japan 's nuclear watchdog , the nuclear regulation authority , had previously given a green light to the reopening of reactors 3 and 4 of the kansai electric power company 's takahama nuclear plant .
locals successfully petitioned the court in fukui prefecture , where the plant is located , raising concerns about whether the reactors would survive a strong earthquake .

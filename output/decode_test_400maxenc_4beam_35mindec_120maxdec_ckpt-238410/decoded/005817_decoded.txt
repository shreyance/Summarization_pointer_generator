new haven superior court judge thomas o'keefe jr. ruled monday that 49-year-old lishan wang should be sent to connecticut valley hospital for treatment .
in a court report submitted last month , mental health experts said wang displayed ` paranoid thinking ' and was ` guarded and suspicious ' when discussing a relationship with court-appointed lawyers .
lishan wang was charged with murder in the shooting of yale university doctor vajinder toor outside his home in april 2010 .

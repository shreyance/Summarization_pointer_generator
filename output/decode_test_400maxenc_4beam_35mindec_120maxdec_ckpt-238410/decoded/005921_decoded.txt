hay castle was built in the late 12th century by the powerful norman lord william de braose .
the remains of the castle include a four-storey norman keep and gateway , a jacobean mansion was built alongside the tower in 1660 , and victorian terraced gardens .
the rescue plan also includes tackling the rambling ivy which is further putting parts of it at risk of collapse .

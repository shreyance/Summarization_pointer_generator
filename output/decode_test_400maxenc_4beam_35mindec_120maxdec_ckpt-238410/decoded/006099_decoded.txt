researchers found that during recovery periods between periods of exercise , it did n't matter what food was eaten .
performance remained the same after resting for several hours , while levels of glycogen - used by muscles as ` fuel ' - were actually slightly higher after fast food was eaten as a recovery food .
research led by the university of montana has found that eating fast food after a workout may be just as beneficial as dietary supplements .
the research , published in the international journal of sport nutrition and exercise metabolism , was led by university of montana graduate student michael cramer .

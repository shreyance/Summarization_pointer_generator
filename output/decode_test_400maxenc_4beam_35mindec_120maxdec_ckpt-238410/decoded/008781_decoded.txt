the nantucket wooden chair was salvaged by a search team from the atlantic ocean after the titanic sank in 1912 .
dubbed ` one of the rarest types of titanic collectable ' , the chair is too fragile to sit on , but has been carefully preserved , having been owned by a british collector for the past 15 years .

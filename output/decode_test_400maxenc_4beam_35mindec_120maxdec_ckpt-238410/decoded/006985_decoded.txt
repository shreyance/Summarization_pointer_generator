justin bettman caught the media 's attention a few months ago when he began his ` set in the street ' project .
bettman , sometimes with designer gozde eker , would build sets that , in pictures , looked like the inside of a living room , child 's bedroom , or a bathroom complete with a clawfoot tub .
bettman 's work caught the attention of jose luis , who saw a feature on the photographer in new york magazine .

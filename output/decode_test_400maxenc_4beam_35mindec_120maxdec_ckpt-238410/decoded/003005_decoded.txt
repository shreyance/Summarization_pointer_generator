mathews has won the interim wba lightweight title after being handed a unanimous points decision over tony luis in liverpool .
mathews saw richar abril twice pull out of a fight due to illness to be striped of the belt and just this week replacement ismael barroso was forced to pull out after failing to obtain a visa .
mathews made the brighter start and kept luis contained behind the jab while landing a decent uppercut at the end of the second round .

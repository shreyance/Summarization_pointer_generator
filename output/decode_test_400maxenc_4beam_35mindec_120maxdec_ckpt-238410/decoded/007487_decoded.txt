kejonuma leisure land , in tohoku , japan , attracted hundreds of thousands of visitors .
the once-bustling family-friendly attraction closed its doors officially in 2000 following a drop in visitors , attributed to japan 's low birth rate and economic collapse .
today , the deserted merry-go-round and other relics of a bygone era are tourist attractions in their own right .

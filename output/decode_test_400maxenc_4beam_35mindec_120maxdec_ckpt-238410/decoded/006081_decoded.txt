detlef guenzel chopped polish-born wojciech stempniewicz into small pieces while listening to pop music before burying them in the garden of his home in hartmannsdorf-reichenau in 2013 .
` he was found guilty of murder and disturbing the peace of the dead , ' said presiding judge birgit wiegand at the regional court in the eastern city of dresden .
prosecutors said they stopped short of this demand because stempniewicz said he wanted to die .

qasr al-farid or ` the lonely castle ' has a sad tale , standing incomplete and abandoned , looking out of place in the vast , barren landscape .
believed to be constructed in the first century a.d. and situated on one of the most important ancient trade routes , linking the north and south .
size matters ! the striking structure is the largest of the 131 tombs in the area .

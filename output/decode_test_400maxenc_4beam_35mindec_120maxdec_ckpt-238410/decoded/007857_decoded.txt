german photographer dieter klein travelled the world to find vintage cars left to crumble in leafy forests and fields .
he came across a range of mysterious graveyards hosting all sorts of vehicles , including a rare jaguar xk120 , which , if restored , could be worth # 82,000 .
many of the cars , often with doors , tires or windows missing , are parked on forest floors where nature has taken them over .

mario valencia took a rifle from a walmart in tuscon , arizona on february 19 .
he was able to start firing it as soon as he left , something that should have been impossible due to the gun locks that are required on all weapons .
the stolen weapon should have still been locked and police chasing the men were told he could not fire the loaded gun .

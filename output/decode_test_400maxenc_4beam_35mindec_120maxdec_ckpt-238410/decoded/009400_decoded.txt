the viva las vegas rockabilly weekend - now in its 18th year , is a flashback to classic cars , vintage pinups , tiki drinks , tattoos and a fashion aesthetic that balances high heels with just as high hair .
organizers have added a second music-only event - the rockabilly rockout - in october at the gold coast hotel & casino that harkens back to the event 's roots .

coronation street star samia ghadie and boyfriend sylvain longchambon take a selfie in new york .
they returned to the city that never sleeps in january 2001 , eight months before the terrible events of 9/11 , and one of the first things my boyfriend sylvain longchambon and i did on my latest trip was to visit the site of the world trade center to see the monument to those who died .
it was a very poignant moment of coronation street star samia ghadie and boyfriend sylvain longchambon .

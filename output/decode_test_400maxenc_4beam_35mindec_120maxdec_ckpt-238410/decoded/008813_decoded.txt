the four-bedroom property in central london has all the trappings of modern luxury with an indoor swimming pool , gym , lift , cinema room and roof terrace .
originally used as a milking parlour , it became a depot before being knocked down in the 19th century .
in 2011 developers took over the site and demolished the house to make way for the plush mansion which now sits in its place .

vet nick fisher , 31 , from leintwardine , shropshire , said twiglet was left behaving strangely after swallowing the unidentified substance while on a walk near their home last monday .
the four-year-old hound seemed to think he was being chased and had dilated pupils and bloodshot eyes after eating the drug .
but after 45 minutes of drooling at the mouth uncontrollably , shaking and walking into walls twiglet seemed back to normal .

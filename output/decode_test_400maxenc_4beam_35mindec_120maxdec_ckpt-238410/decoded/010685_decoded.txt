vladmir lenin may have been dead for 90 years , but his corpse looks better than the day he passed .
this is the claim made by his embalmers , who have developed experimental techniques to maintain the look and feel of the communist revolutionary 's body .
the gruesome job is the responsibility of a team known as the ` mausoleum group ' which , at its peak , involved 200 scientists working in a lab dedicated to the former leader 's corpse .

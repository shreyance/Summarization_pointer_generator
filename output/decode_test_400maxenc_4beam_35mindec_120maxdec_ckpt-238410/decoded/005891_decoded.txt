church of england schools should stop selecting pupils on faith because it discriminates against the poor , a group of vicars has claimed .
they say the system is open to abuse and many oversubscribed schools reject non-churchgoing families even though they may live nearby .
many christian schools give priority to families who regularly attend services , a practice which they say preserves their faith ethos .
but a group of vicars say it can lead to discrimination against the poor .

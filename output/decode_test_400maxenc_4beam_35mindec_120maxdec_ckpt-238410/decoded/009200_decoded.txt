evansville in comanche county , kansas , is a shadow of its former self , with its once-thriving commissary building in a state of disrepair .
the couple , who live in a house just north of the commissary building , do not have to worry about unexpected visitors , nor noisy neighbors .
however , the ghost town is still home to two final residents , who tend to the site 's numerous cattle - rancher larry ` dee ' scherich and his wife phyllis .

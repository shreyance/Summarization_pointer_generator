naomi jacobs was 32 when she woke up terrified of her son .
she had been struck with transient global amnesia , a form of memory loss brought on by stress that had wiped the ` episodic ' part of her memory .
the last thing she could remember was falling asleep in her bunk bed as a schoolgirl , dreaming about a boy she had a crush on .
she thought it was 1992 , john major was prime minister .

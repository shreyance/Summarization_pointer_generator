rhiannon wilkinson , head of wycombe abbey in buckinghamshire , reportedly said a ` boy free ' environment stops girls from being held back by the opposite sex , who are known to mature slower .
she also suggested single-sex boarding schools give pupils relief and protection from the ` highly sexualised world ' and allow them to ` remain girls for longer .
' ` my wide educational experience in both mixed and girls ' schools has shown me clearly that girls are best served educationally in their teenage years in a boy-free work environment .

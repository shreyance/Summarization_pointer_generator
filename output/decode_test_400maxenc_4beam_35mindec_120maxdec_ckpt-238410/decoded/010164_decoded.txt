written in greek , one of the medical recipes offers advice for how to tackle a ` drunken headache ' - with the leaves of the evergreen plant , also called ruscus racemosus , together and possibly wearing it around the neck .
this papyrus was found in oxyrhynchus , egypt , and contains a medical ` recipe ' for treating a hangover .

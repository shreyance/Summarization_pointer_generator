massachusetts senator elizabeth warren said she 's relieved dzhokhar tsarnaev has been found guilty of carrying out the boston bombing - the greatest tragedy in her state 's recent history - but does n't believe he should be executed .
in an interview with cbs this morning on thursday , warren reacted to wednesday 's jury verdict which found the 21-year-old guilty on all 30 charges related to the boston marathon explosions which killed three and injured hundreds at the finish line .
` nothing is ever going to make those who were injured whole and it 's been a terrible thing but this is a step toward justice , ' warren said .

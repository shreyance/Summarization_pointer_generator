judge john koeltl said in a decision made public tuesday that the incendiary ad is speech protected under the first amendment .
he said he was sensitive to the metropolitan transportation authority 's claim that the poster could incite violence and appreciates the efforts necessary to prevent violent attacks targeting jewish people .
but he noted that substantially the same advertisement ran in san francisco and chicago in 2013 without incident .

researchers have uncovered the reason why skin is so difficult to tear even when put under extreme pressures .
they found that rather than simply tearing , mammalian skin actually has sophisticated stress resistance properties that prevent holes and cuts from expanding .
the researchers cut real skin samples and attempted to rip them by pulling them apart -lrb- shown above -rrb- .
using x-ray beams they were able to directly observe the microscopic changes that prevent holes and cuts from expanding .

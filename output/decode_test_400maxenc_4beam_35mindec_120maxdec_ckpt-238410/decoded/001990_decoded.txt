manchester city have laid on free coaches to take their supporters to london for monday 's premier league clash with crystal palace .
the move was made after tv scheduling for the 8pm kick-off made it virtually impossible for supporters to return home by either train or plane on the same night .
david silva scored in city 's 3-0 defeat of crystal palace earlier this season .

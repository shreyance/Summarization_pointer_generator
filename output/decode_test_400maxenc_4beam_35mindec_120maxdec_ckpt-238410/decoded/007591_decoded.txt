malaysia has passed a controversial terror law aimed at tackling growing support for islamic state extremists .
the prevention of terrorism act passed in the capital kuala lumpur yesterday - officially enables authorities to detain suspected terrorists for two years without charge or trial .
but it also allows for the authorities to apply for unlimited extensions after those two years expire - something that will be decided by a government-appointed terrorism board , not a judge and jury .

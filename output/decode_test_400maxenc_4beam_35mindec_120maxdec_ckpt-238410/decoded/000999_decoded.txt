the flight voice recorder aboard germanwings flight 9525 reportedly captured blaring cockpit alarms , warning co-pilot andreas lubitz to `` pull up '' and that that was not enough to stop the aircraft from slamming into the french alps .
the technology would work in a fashion similar to crash avoidance technology already used in automobiles .
if a pilot is incapacitated or ignores audible warnings , the plane 's flight guidance software could take over and plot a course to a safe altitude .

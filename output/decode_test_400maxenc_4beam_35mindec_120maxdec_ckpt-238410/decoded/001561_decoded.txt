john carver knows only too well that a tyne-wear derby can make or break a manager .
his first in the dugout was as assistant to ruud gullit in 1999 , when on a sodden night at st james ' park the dutchman left out alan shearer and duncan ferguson and paid for his selection with his job after a 2-1 defeat .
carver is now fighting to win the head coach position beyond the end of this season .

adelaide , the mercury was whizzing up to a sizzling 46c and the south australian city was the hottest place on the planet .
the temperature had climbed above 40c for a whole week and even the aussies were struggling .
appropriately , friends took us out that evening to dine in one of the city 's hottest restaurants - celsius ! luckily , it was air-conditioned and served phenomenal food .

locals from the island of kudahuvadhoo , located in the southern area of kudahuvadhoo , reported witnessing ' a low-flying jumbo jet ' on the morning of march 8 last year , when the flight disappeared while travelling from kuala lumpur to beijing with 239 people on board .
the reports come as scientists from curtin university refuse to rule out the possibility that ` distinctive ' data they recorded from the area at the assumed time of the crash may have come from the impact of the aircraft .

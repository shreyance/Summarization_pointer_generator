names of 9th battalion australians engraved on the walls of the former chalk quarry in naours , northern france .
the inscriptions were found in naours - a two-hour drive north of paris - where more than a million men were killed or wounded .
only the date next to it - april 1 , 1917 - roots it in the horrors of the first world war .

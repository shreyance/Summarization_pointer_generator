42-year-old david serbeck , pictured in court in 2010 , are asking an appeals court to either throw out his sex with a minor conviction or sentence .
serbeck 's original lawyers should have pushed harder to exclude or dispute allegations tying his 2007 relationship with the 17-year-old victim to his shooting .
two years after he had sex with the 17-year-old , serbeck was shot and paralyzed in july 2009 by reginald campos , who suspected serbeck of aggressively following his daughter in an suv while patrolling their buffdale neighborhood .

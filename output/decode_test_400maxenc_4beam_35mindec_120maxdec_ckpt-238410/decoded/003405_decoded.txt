chelsea manager jose mourinho said he was unfazed by his side 's staggeringly low possession stat during the 1-0 win over manchester united .
the blues , who secured victory through forward eden hazard 's first-half strike , held the ball for just 29 per cent of the match at stamford bridge .
mourinho 's men could wrap up the title as early as april 29 .

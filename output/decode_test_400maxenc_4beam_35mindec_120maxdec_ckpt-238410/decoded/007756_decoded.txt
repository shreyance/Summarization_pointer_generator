representative jesse young wants to use two or three carriers to link bremerton and port orchard across the sinclair inlet .
a proposal put forth by young which would use money from the state 's highway budget to fund a feasibility study about the bridge passed in the washington house on thursday .
the idea is intriguing because the us navy is storing three retired carriers just a few hundred yards from the proposed site of the bridge .

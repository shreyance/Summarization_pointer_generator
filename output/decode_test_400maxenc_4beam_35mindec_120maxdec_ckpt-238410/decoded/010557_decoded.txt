deborah kane had her right eye removed three years ago in a life-saving nine-hour operation to stop the cancer spreading to her brain .
the 46-year-old teaching assistant believes her cancer developed from getting badly burned on holiday in lanzarote when she was 15 - where she also bought cheap sunglasses without proper uv protection .
she hopes to repeat the event annually and has so far raised over # 10,000 for the royal manchester eye hospital .

a freight train carrying a dangerous form of ammonia derailed in a rural area of south carolina on friday night .
the train was traveling through salters pond and highway 121 , near the town of trenton , shortly after 8.30 pm when it derailed after apparently hitting a tree that had fallen onto the tracks .
at the time , the vehicle was carrying anhydrous ammonia - a highly toxic , nitrogen-based chemical that can form explosive mixtures with air .
the derailment caused up to 15 cars to overturn and leak .

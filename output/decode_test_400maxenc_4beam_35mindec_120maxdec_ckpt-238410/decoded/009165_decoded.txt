police in ragusa , a sicilian port town , arrested three syrian men who were at the helm of the turkish-flagged yacht attempting to reach the italian coast .
it is thought the smugglers had charged each person $ 8,500 -lrb- # 5,700 -rrb- to make the crossing .
this is far more than the usual cost of between 1,000 and 1,500 euros - # 720 to cross the mediterranean to europe .

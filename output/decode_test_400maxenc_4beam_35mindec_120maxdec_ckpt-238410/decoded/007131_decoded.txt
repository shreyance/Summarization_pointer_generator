sources close to the investigation , which is being led by the counter-terrorism unit , told the sunday times that abdul hadi arwani , an opponent of syrian president bahsar al-assad .
arwani , 48 , was shot and killed in his car on a quiet street in north west london after being called there last tuesday .
when the imam , who had links to the muslim brotherhood in the uk and abroad , arrived to the house with his son and not on his own , the supposed potential client asked arwani to come back another day .

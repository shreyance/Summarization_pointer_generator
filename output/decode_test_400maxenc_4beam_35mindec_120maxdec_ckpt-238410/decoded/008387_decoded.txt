dashcam footage shows the officers using their patrol vehicles to steer the one ton bison off the road and back to his farm near the city of round rock .
the buffalo made it past electric fence and a barbed wire barrier to escape his pen last friday morning around 7am .
police say they gave his owner a citation for violating the ` open range act ' with inadequate fencing .

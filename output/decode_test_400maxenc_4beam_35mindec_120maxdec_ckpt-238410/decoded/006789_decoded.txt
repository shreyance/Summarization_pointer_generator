biso the cat , who was stuck behind a wall in a cairo train station , has been freed at last .
biso had squeezed into the hole in the wall at the mohamed naguib metro station as a kitten in 2010 - but then soon became to big to escape .
he survived thanks to an elderly man called uncle abdo who fed him scraps of food every day .

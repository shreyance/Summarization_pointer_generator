mercedes boss wolff has revealed the team may have to make ` an unpopular call ' for their drivers in light of ferrari 's revival this season .
following the first three races of the new formula one season it is clear mercedes will not have it all their own way as ferrari appear poised to push them all the way .
wolff 's remark also comes in the wake of nico rosberg 's moaning over the team radio during sunday 's chinese grand prix about how slow team-mate lewis hamilton was driving .

nick clegg made a desperate bid to distance his party from allegations about cyril smith .
he claimed the obese sexual predator did not belong to the liberal democrats at the time he was abusing scores of young boys .
in fact smith took the party whip for four years in parliament and was feted as a lib-dem grandee in the years before he died .
mr clegg was accused on a radio phone-in of having ` washed his hands ' of the issue .

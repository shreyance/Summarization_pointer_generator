ba van nguyen was able to fly a ch-47 chinook , the largest helicopter in the south vietnamese army , with his three young children and wife out of the city and into the south china sea where they were all ultimately saved by the uss kirk .
this after nguyen somehow managed to pilot the helicopter while getting out of his flight suit and jumping into the ocean just seconds before it crashed - all on his own .

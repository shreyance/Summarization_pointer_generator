the rensselaer polytechnic institute in new york has pushed back its planned screening of the iraq war film which was set for last friday .
it said it will still show the oscar-nominated movie but with an educational forum follow-up to allow students to discuss the film .
the film was postponed because senior management at the college did not want to create animosity or tension among its students .

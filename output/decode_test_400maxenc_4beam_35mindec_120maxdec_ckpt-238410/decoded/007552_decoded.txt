students at wellington college , berkshire , spent the last year studying a different classic book for their imminent as-level exam .
the mistake only came to light when mock papers arrived and no exam questions related to the taught text .
now pupils will have to cram their studying into just a few weeks with extra lessons put in place by the school .

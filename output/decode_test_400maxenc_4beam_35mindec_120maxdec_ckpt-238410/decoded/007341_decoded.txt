disgraced davis high school educator brianne altice , 35 , was ordered last month to stand trial on 14 felony charges , including rape , sodomy , sexual abuse and sex with a minor .
one of the alleged victims brought a $ 647,000 lawsuit against the utah school district accusing officials of negligence for failing to fire the ` flirtatious ' teacher before she started a sexual relationship with him .
the latest lawsuit , filed last week , describes how altice began flirting with the student , then 16 , and other boys in her class .

frida ghitis : the mass killings of armenians in the ottoman empire , which began 100 years ago friday , is said by some scholars and others to have been the first genocide of the 20th century .
the issue of whether to call the killings a genocide is emotional , both for armenians , who are descended from those killed , and for turks , the question touches as much on historical facts .
for both groups , the question touches as much on national identity as on historical facts .

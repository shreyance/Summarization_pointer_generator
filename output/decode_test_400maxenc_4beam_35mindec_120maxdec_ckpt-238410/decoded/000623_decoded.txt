the latest estimates from seismologists put the magnitude at 7.9 , which would actually makes it about 40 % larger than the 7.8 currently being reported .
that 's less than half the size of the previous major event nearby in 1934 , which killed around 10,000 people .
unfortunately , it is quite possible the number of dead in kathmandu could rise to match it .

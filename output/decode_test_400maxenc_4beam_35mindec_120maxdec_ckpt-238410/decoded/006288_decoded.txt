the maticevski show at mercedes-benz fashion week australia on tuesday went above and beyond to impress guests .
but a few of the highly-prized gifts went missing when someone with sticky fingers - perhaps a disgruntled second row guest - decided to snap them up for themselves .
despite the drama , the show was a spectacular success , with an a-list turn-out and dazzling creations gracing the catwalk .

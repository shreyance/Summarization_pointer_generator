ed miliband has been getting a lot of praise for admitting that he ` blubbed ' while watching pride , a british film released last year .
it 's a rose-tinted , nostalgic look back at a critical moment in 20th-century british history .
every drop of sentiment is wrung out of the story , with brave young men and women risking their lives to take on an evil dictator .

everton manager roberto martinez has not ruled out the prospect of antolin alcaraz or sylvain distin .
both centre-backs ' current deals expire this summer and it seems highly unlikely distin , who is 38 in december and has played more for the under-21s in the last month than he has the first team , who is 38 in december .
alcaraz , 33 in july , has more of a chance of securing a short-term extension as martinez looks to strengthen and restructure his defence in the summer .

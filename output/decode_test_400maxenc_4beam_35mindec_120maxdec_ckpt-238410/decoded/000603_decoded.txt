frida ghitis : when the earthquake struck , we huddled under a concrete beam .
outside , a brown dust-cloud rose from the ruins of cottages that had dotted the next hill .
after escaping the building for the safety of open air , my first thought was for news of friends and family .
calls did n't go through but thankfully texts and data did .

the tunnels were dug into sandstone cliffs along the river mersey in stockport in the 1930s .
following the outbreak of the second world war , the space was redeveloped as an air raid shelter where residents of lancashire and cheshire could hide from nazi bombs .
the shelter became so popular that local officials had to issue season tickets limiting the number of people who would be allowed to seek refuge there .

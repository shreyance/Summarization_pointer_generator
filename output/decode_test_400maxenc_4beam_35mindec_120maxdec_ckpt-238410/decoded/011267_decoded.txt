lord janner sent a ` thank you ' christmas card to a detective after learning he would escape child sex abuse charges .
the officer said he was appalled by the labour peer 's note after his superiors forced him to drop his inquiries into janner 's alleged sex abuse .
the note thanked him for how he had dealt with the issue , and even invited him and his wife to dinner at parliament .
but she went on to rule that the 86-year-old peer should not face prosecution because of his dementia .

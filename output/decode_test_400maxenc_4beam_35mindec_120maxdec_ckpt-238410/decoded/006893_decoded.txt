more than 70,000 people across the world have signed a petition demanding mcdonald 's remove spikes that deter the homeless from sleeping outside one of its restaurants .
the fast food giant has defended the use of the spikes , claiming they were installed two years ago in an attempt to stop anti-social behaviour .
but critics say they have been put in because they are uncomfortable to sleep on and installed on areas which used to be benches .

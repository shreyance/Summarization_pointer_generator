amnesty international says siti zainab 's family was not notified before her execution .
the domestic worker was sentenced to death in 1999 after confessing to stabbing her employer who allegedly mistreated her to death .
she was on death row for over 15 years while saudi authorities waited for the victim 's youngest child to reach adulthood .
but the sentence was carried out despite their claims that zainab 's family and officials were not given adequate notice or information before she was killed .

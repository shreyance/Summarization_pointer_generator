nine council workers have been sacked for inappropriately accessing confidential social work files on tragic toddler mikaeel kular .
the three-year-old was killed by his mother rosdeep adekoya , who beat him for being sick and left him to die in agony for three days before hiding his body in a suitcase and dumping it in woods .
she then told police the boy had wandered off , sparking a huge manhunt before eventually leading officers to the body near kirkcaldy in fife , in january last year .
police scotland probed the claims and internal investigation was launched by fife council last year .

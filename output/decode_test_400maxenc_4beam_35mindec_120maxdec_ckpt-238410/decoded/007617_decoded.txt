a chinese woman has become an internet sensation after charting life with her pet pig who she dresses , walks and even sleeps with every day .
the woman , who calls herself zhu diandian online , has raised her beloved five flowers since it was a piglet and the porker has now grown to a whopping 187lbs -lrb- 13st -rrb- .
but that has nothing to weaken the bond between the two , with ms zhu proudly posting pictures of them snuggled up in bed together .

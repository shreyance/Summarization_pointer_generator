le manoir is a striking building ; a 15th century manor house built with golden bricks and burgundy roof tiles .
the impeccably kept grounds included perfectly trimmed lawns , bronze sculptures , and boasting tall chimney stacks and climbing wisteria .
it is beautiful - and it 's impossible not to gawp .

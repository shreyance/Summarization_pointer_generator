alexander bradley appeared in bristol county superior court on wednesday .
he would be able to testify that hernandez had access to the type of pistol he is accused of using to murder semipro football player odin lloyd , but not about a separate 2013 incident in which bradley contends hernandez shot him in the face .
bradley , who has sued hernandez over a february 2013 shooting incident , will be allowed to tell jurors he saw someone hand hernandez a black glock pistol in a miami hotel .

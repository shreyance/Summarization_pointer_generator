british company swan , which sold its first iron in 1933 , has just released a top-of-the-range steam generator iron , for # 279.99 .
but when testing this one , i got to work in front of poldark and was done within 20 minutes .
because all the water is in the separate 1,000 ml generator tank , the iron itself is lightweight .

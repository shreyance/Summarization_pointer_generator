lucian faggiano bought the building in lecce , puglia in the south of italy .
renovations were put on hold when he discovered a toilet on the site was blocked .
while attempting to fix the toilet he dug into a messapian tomb built 2,000 years ago , a roman granary , a franciscan chapel , and even etchings thought to be made by the knights templar .

the union square farmer 's market , open on weekend mornings , is fantastic for people-watching and you ca n't beat a stroll along the recently-opened highline with its breathtaking views of the hudson river .
in the warmer months , a stroll through central park is the ultimate no-cost activity for locals and visitors alike .

frida ghitis : this week 's attack on garissa university college is al-shabaab 's fifth major assault .
al-shabaab says its attacks are to protest the more than 3,500 kenyan soldiers participating in somalia .
but if that is the case , why does n't al-shabaab target kenyan military bases rather than attacking undefended .

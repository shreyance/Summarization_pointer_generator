jonny bucknell , 58 , was enjoying meal in the council chamber when a labour rival , theo blackwell , spotted him and alerted other councillors .
he was forced to put down his cutlery when the mayor , lazzaro pietragnoli , interrupted the proceedings to tell him off .
he now says he wants a rule change so he can eat a roast dinner at council meetings .

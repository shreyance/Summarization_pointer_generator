douglas murphy was cleaning up after a children 's picnic when he bumped his leg against a bin bag .
though the 47-year-old barely registered it at the time , the scrape almost cost him his right leg .
a cut so small it was hardly visible , causing the rare condition faciitis - a flesh-eating bug .
so extreme was mr murphy 's infection , surgeons were preparing to amputate his right leg .

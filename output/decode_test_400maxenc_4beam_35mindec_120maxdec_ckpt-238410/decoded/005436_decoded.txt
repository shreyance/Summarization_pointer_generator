school spokesman michael schoenfeld said the school would not release the name of the student who admitted to hanging the noose , found early wednesday in a plaza area at the heart of the campus .
the student was identified with information provided by other students and will be subject to duke 's student conduct and that an investigation is continuing to find out if others were involved .
the noose is a particularly sensitive image in the state , where black residents were once terrorized by lynchings .

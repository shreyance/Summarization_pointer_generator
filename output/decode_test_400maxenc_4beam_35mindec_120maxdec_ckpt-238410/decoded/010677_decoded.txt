rachael bishop , 19 , was working an afternoon shift at the ice cream chain 's lynnwood store when a man wearing a baseball cap and sunglasses came in , unzipped his jacket and showed her he had a gun .
bishop said she tried to plead with the man when he ordered her to hand over all the money in the cash register .
as the man reached into the till , bishop tried to swat his hand away .
when that did n't stop him , she started punching him in the head multiple times .

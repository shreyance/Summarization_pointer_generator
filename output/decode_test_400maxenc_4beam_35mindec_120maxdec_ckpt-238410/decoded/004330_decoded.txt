a london council is to introduce csi-style dna testing for dogs so it can track and fine owners who do n't clean up after their animals .
the laboratory testing is believed to be 99.9 per cent accurate .
the council hopes that the collection of dna samples would fit well with new national laws requiring all owners in britain to microchip their dogs by april next year .

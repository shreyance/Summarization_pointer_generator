labour leader ed miliband said he does not live in a ` mansion ' on homes worth more than # 2million but claimed this did not mean he actually lived in one .
the claim comes despite revelations that his four-storey victorian town house has two kitchens .
including one for the family 's live-in nanny .
mr miliband , speaking on radio 2 's jeremy vine show this afternoon , insisted his home was not a mansion .

meaghan hudson , 25 , left those closest to her devastated when she sent text messages in december 2013 .
saying she was suffering from multiple myeloma , a type of cancer which forms in the bone marrow , and she was unlikely to survive .
miss hudson 's friends , who have known her since high school in dayton , ohio , went to great lengths to show their support - they shaved their heads in solidarity for her chemo .
well-wishers sent $ 5,000 towards her ` medical expenses ' and high school friend chelsey whild .

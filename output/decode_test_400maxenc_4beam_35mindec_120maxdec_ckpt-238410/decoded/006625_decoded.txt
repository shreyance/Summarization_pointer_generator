scientists have shown that using deep brain stimulation -lrb- dbs -rrb- , a technique already used to treat parkinson 's disease , can boost memory by causing new brain cells to be formed .
a ` pacemaker ' fitted with electrodes is inserted into the brain through holes drilled in the skull .
deep brain stimulation is already used to treat parkinson 's , but now researchers now believe it could be used to improve brain function .

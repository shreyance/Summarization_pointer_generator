new figures from the uk civil aviation authority shows 238m passengers passed through british airports in 2014 .
just three million less than the pre-recession boom peak of 241m in 2007 and 10m more -lrb- a 4.4 per cent rise -rrb- than 2013 .
as would be expected , most passengers -lrb- 144m -rrb- fly to europe which enjoyed a 5.4 per cent rise year on year in visitors from the uk .

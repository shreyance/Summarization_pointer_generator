the prize porker had fallen into the pool in an upmarket neighbourhood in ringwood , hampshire .
his owners had been taking him for a walk around the garden when the animal plunged into the water and was unable to get out again .
the two-hour rescue operation ended with the wayward horse being fitted with straps under her belly and lifted up into the air .

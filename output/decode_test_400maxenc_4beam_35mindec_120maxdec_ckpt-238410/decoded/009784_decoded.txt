the new app uses a quick response code , or qr code , which is a form of barcode that the cameras of mobile phones are able to detect .
under mr smagon 's concept , a code matched specifically to your app can be printed on your favourite mug or a fridge magnet .
the alarm is set to go off at a certain time the night before and will make a noise until the qr code is scanned .

jack nicklaus recorded his first hole-in-one at the masters on wednesday .
villegas holed out on the fourth and eighth as he finished alongside kevin streelman on five under par , only to find water on the eighth when he played it again as the third play-off hole .
streelman therefore became the latest player to be saddled with the ` curse ' of the par-three champion .

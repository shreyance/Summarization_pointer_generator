rosemary taylor made the ` racist ' remark to hired photographer nelson jones at the local cherry blossom festival two weeks ago .
after witnessing mr jones capture a test shot of models dominique jackson , 18 , and 19-year-old khamlee vongvone at the event , she apparently went over to him and referenced the two girls .
ms taylor has released her own statement , in which she claims she was wrongly accused in the incident .

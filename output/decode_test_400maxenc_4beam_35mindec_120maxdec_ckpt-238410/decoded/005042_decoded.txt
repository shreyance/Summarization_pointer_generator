scientists have discovered strange new organisms that infect the primitive forms of life that live deep below the ocean floor .
while examining species of bacteria thrive on the fossil fuel deposits deep inside the earth - known as archae - they have found a new type of virus that live deep below the ocean floor .
this is because the virus actively causes one of its own genes to mutate - allowing it to develop new ways of coping with the ecosystem it finds itself in .
life has been discovered nearly a mile and half underground .

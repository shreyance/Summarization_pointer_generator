a zoo in ohio is celebrating the ` miracle ' birth of rare amur tiger cubs after it was feared their mother 's biological clock had stopped ticking .
keepers at the columbus zoo say ten-year-old irisa had mated before but never conceived .
while the birth on tuesday morning went smoothly , irisa failed to show any maternal care so her offspring are currently being hand-reared in an incubator .
